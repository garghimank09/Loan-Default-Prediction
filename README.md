# Loan-Default-Prediction
Loan Default Prediction
📌 Overview

This project focuses on building a Machine Learning model to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default or not. The model uses historical loan applicant data and applies various ML algorithms to identify patterns that distinguish defaulters from non-defaulters.

The project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook and leverages popular libraries for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building.

🚀 Features

📊 Workflow

Data Collection – Import dataset for loan applications.

Data Preprocessing – Handle missing values, categorical encoding, feature scaling.

EDA – Visualize relationships between variables.

Model Building – Train models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, etc.

Evaluation – Use accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to measure performance.

Prediction – Deploy the best-performing model to predict loan default.

📈 Results

Identified key features influencing loan default.

Achieved high accuracy and balanced performance across metrics.

Logistic Regression / Random Forest (whichever was best in your notebook) provided the best results.

📌 Future Improvements

Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.

Use of advanced models like XGBoost, LightGBM, or Neural Networks.

Deployment using Flask/Streamlit for real-time prediction.
